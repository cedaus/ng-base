        <h3>About Project</h3>
        <p>I'm a 5 years experienced Product Engineer, where I have co-founded a product lab and lead product
            engineering at gig-economy startup with marque investors. My expertise as full-stack engineer helps me
            build complete web product and I am also apt with product management skills like user experience,
            feature priortization and market fit.</p>
        
        <p>I've built this project as my learning over the years in web application development. But the project resources are not just limited to my own learning, it is also inspired by a lot of open source code from developer community and so I have kept the project codes to be completely open and to be freely used by the community.</p>

                <h4>Angular Code Repository</h4>
                <p>
                    This repository comprises of complete UI and feature level code built with HTML/CSS and Angular. I have tried the look and feel of project to be minimalistic and pluggable for easy integration with other project.
